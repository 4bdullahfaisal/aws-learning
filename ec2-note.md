## What I Did Today:
- Launched my first EC2 instance (t2.micro, Amazon Linux).
- Connected via SSH using Git Bash.
- Practiced Linux commands:
  - `pwd`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `cd`, `echo`, `cat`
- Created files and folders on EC2.
- Learned about Security Groups (HTTP, SSH).

## Commands I Ran:
- mkdir test
- cd test
- echo "I did this myself!" > success.txt
- cat success.txt
